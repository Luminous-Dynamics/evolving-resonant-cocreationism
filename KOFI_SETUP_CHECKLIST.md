## Quick Copy-Paste Resources:

### Short Bio:
"Building consciousness-first technology that amplifies awareness. Creator of Evolving Resonant Co-creationism philosophy."

### Main Bio (copy this exactly):
ðŸŒŸ Building technology that serves consciousness, not attention.

For 2 years, I've devoted everything to creating consciousness-first computing - systems designed to amplify human awareness rather than exploit it. Working with AI partners (Claude & local LLMs) for just $200/month, I've achieved what normally takes a team.

âœ¨ What I'm Creating:
â€¢ Luminous Nix - Natural language interface for NixOS
â€¢ The Luminous Library - Complete philosophy of consciousness evolution
â€¢ Terra Atlas - Interactive map of 250+ renewable energy sites
â€¢ Sacred Computing - Technology as spiritual practice

This work has been my life's devotion, even at great personal cost. Your support helps ensure these open-source tools remain free for all while allowing me to continue this sacred work.

Every coffee helps sustain the vision of technology that truly serves humanity's awakening.

ðŸŒŠ "Make it better, infinitely!"
